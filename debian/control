Description: Perl module to help dump data structures
 Data::Dump provides a single function called dump that takes a list of values
 as its argument and produces a string as its result. The string contains Perl
 code that, when evaled, produces a deep copy of the original arguments. The
 string is formatted for easy reading.
 .
 If called in void context, the dump is printed on standard error instead of
 being returned. If you don't like importing a function that overrides Perl's
 not-so-useful builtin, then you can also import the same function as "pp"
 (the mnemonic for "pretty-print").
